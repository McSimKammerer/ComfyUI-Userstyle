# ComfyUI-Userstyle
A userstyle for your ComfyUI! Install using the browser plugin "stylus".
Based on [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/comfyui/comments/15yd0vw/theme_the_comfyui_menu_and_fix_some_annoying/), using [knitigz CSS](https://codefile.io/f/seArZMvMyP) as a base.

This is to be used in conjuction with the custom color palette from [ComfyUI Easy Use](https://github.com/yolain/ComfyUI-Easy-Use). Works with the others as well, but I used this as my base.
Also use [Comfy Workspace Manager](https://github.com/11cafe/comfyui-workspace-manager) to take advantage of the window on the left, as well as gain a WHOLE HOST of amazing organization features for your image generation needs.
