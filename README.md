# ComfyUI-Userstyle
A userstyle for your [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)! Install using the browser plugin "stylus".
Based on [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/comfyui/comments/15yd0vw/theme_the_comfyui_menu_and_fix_some_annoying/), using [knitigz CSS](https://codefile.io/f/seArZMvMyP) as a base.

This is to be used in conjuction with the custom color palette from [ComfyUI Easy Use](https://github.com/yolain/ComfyUI-Easy-Use). Works with the others as well, but I used this as my base.
Also use [Comfy Workspace Manager](https://github.com/11cafe/comfyui-workspace-manager) to take advantage of the window on the left, as well as gain a WHOLE HOST of amazing organization features for your image generation needs (It's collapsable, don't worry). 

The "image feed" at the bottom is from Pythongosssss's [ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts](https://github.com/pythongosssss/ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts) which is introduced among many other great features. I have it set so that when images are processed and then sent to the feed, it extends upwards to the bottom of the ComfyUI Menu panel. 

Also, it goes without saying, but you should have the [ComfyUI Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager) installed.

Features:
- Upon hovering over a window, it will fade into black and fade back out to a trasparent blur after the mouse leaves it!
- Red "Queue Prompt" button!
- Cyan borders!

Yeah, what you see is really what you get with this. It's a userscript for styling the CSS of the UI, after all.
