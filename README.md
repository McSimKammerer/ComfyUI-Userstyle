# ComfyUI-Userstyle
A userstyle for your [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)! Install using the browser plugin "stylus".
Based on [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/comfyui/comments/15yd0vw/theme_the_comfyui_menu_and_fix_some_annoying/), using [knitigz CSS](https://codefile.io/f/seArZMvMyP) as a base.

This is to be used in conjuction with the custom color palette from [ComfyUI Easy Use](https://github.com/yolain/ComfyUI-Easy-Use). Works with the others as well, but I used this as my base.
Also use [Comfy Workspace Manager](https://github.com/11cafe/comfyui-workspace-manager) to take advantage of the window on the left, as well as gain a WHOLE HOST of amazing organization features for your image generation needs (It's collapsable, don't worry). 

The "image feed" at the bottom is from Pythongosssss's [ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts](https://github.com/pythongosssss/ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts) which is introduced among many other great features. I have it set so that when images are processed and then sent to the feed, it extends upwards to the bottom of the ComfyUI Menu panel.
